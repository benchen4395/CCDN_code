## Code collation
It's an public code repository for [CCDN: Checkerboard Corner Detection Network for Robust Camera Calibration](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-97589-4_27) (ICIRA 2018 oral)

Here is its [pdf of public version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05097).

As a side note, If you are interested in the checkerboard corner detection with deep learning. 

You can see the follow-up paper of this article [Automatic checkerboard detection for camera calibration](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9428389)  (ICME 2021 oral)
