## Code collation
It's an public code repository for [CCDN: Checkerboard Corner Detection Network for Robust Camera Calibration](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-97589-4_27) (ICIRA 2018 oral)

Here is its [pdf of public version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05097).

As a side note, If you are interested in the checkerboard corner detection with deep learning. 

You can see the follow-up paper of this article [Automatic checkerboard detection for camera calibration](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9428389)  (ICME 2021 oral)

## Dataset is public !!!
-- Now we release the training and eval datasets for public research.
- [Training dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/benchen4395/CCDN_eval_dataset): All (a total of 8050 images) were converted to gray-scale images and resized into VGA resolution with (640x480) pixels as the training dataset,
- [Eval dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/benchen4395/CCDN_training_dataset): Including three public datasets: GoPro (100 images), Mesa (206 images) and uEye (206 images), original from [ROCHADE](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10593-2_50) (ECCV 2014 oral).
